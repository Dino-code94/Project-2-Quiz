The typography used for the quiz is based on the **Playpen Sans** font family, which provides a clean, modern, 
and legible appearance. This font is used for the body text and the quiz questions to ensure clarity and readability across different screen sizes. 

For headings and important titles, a **bold** style has been applied to make them stand out and draw attention to key elements.

## Color Scheme

The color scheme used in the quiz is inspired by **Green Day’s branding**, with bold green tones and dark backgrounds that align with the punk rock aesthetic of the band.

- **Primary Color (Green)**: `#00b140` – This green color represents Green Day’s iconic branding. It is used for buttons, links, and key accents throughout the quiz.
- **Secondary Color (Dark Background)**: `#181818` – A dark background that matches the edgy, rock-and-roll style of the band.
- **Text Colors**:
  - **Primary Text**: `#fff` (white) – Used for the body text and quiz content for high contrast and readability.
  - **Secondary Text**: `#b0b0b0` – A softer gray used for secondary text like paragraph content, ensuring the main text stands out.
  - **Feedback Text**: `#f0f0f0` – Light gray used for the feedback messages after each question.

### Button Hover Effect:
- On hover, the green buttons transition to a darker shade (`#007f2a`) to give users feedback when interacting with the buttons.

  - **Mobile devices** (screen width less than 480px)
